# Stream and Notifications Manager
This is just a little project I had in mind, since the default followed live webpage on twitch isn't that great and isn't dynamic with updates, I thought i'd git it a shot and make my own. 
This app is still not fully finished, still testing alot (and still learning alot)

Some things that will come later:
- Being able to change notification settings for people who are currently live.
- Be able to remove followed channels that are live.
- And some more if I think of any.
